# EdaNewIssues
A skeletal repo that contains new EDA issues that are not yet initially reviewed by the dev team

To move an issue out of this repository, please use the following SOP:

1. assign it a milestone
2. assign it a project (ie, to a board)
3. in that project place it in either Needs Triage, or, if urgent, This Cycle
4. assign a cost label
